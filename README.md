## 🚀 What I Do

I design and build robust, modern applications—across both web and mobile—with a strong emphasis on performance, usability, and intelligent features.

My current focus is on leveraging **LLMs and AI models** (via OpenAI) to bring smart, contextual enhancements to everyday apps. Whether it’s a backend service or a mobile UI, I’m always thinking end-to-end.
